# Tornow Quiz

Physics quiz, to memorize the physical quantities, their usual symbol, and their units.

Named after my late physics teacher, Herr Tornow.

## TODO

- make the quiz in the first place, i.e. editable fields
- activate the next button

Later Plans are to remember and then respond to the learners lever, to add formulae, like N = kg/(m*s^2), ability to specify subfield like electro. 

## Dev Howtos

### Development server

Run `npx ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

or, here

npx ng generate component components/<component-name>

npx ng generate service services/<service-name>


### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
